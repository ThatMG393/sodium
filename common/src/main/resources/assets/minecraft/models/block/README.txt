These block models are based on the original game's assets, but with various optimizations applied to reduce
the number of vertices.

The texture mapping of these block models is identical to the originals, so that resource packs which replace the
textures of blocks will not look any different.

If you are a resource pack author and find that your models or textures no longer work correctly with these changes,
please let us know.
